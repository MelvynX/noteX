# NotesApp in VueJS

## Motivation

I was inspired from [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) 📝.

It was my first time using a Framework, I selected `VueJs` 👁 because it looked like it was simple to learn.

## Installation

Clone the repository and add `vuejs`.
Open `index.html`.

Made with ❤️ by me.
